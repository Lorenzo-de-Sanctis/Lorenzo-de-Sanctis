My name is Lorenzo de Sanctis, and I was born in Genova, Italy. I have always been passionate about movies and stories. My dream is to tell stories in every possible way. 
In 2015 I found out about the world behind films, and I started studying on my own. 
In 2018 I went to Nemo Academy in Florence and studied concept art. In 2021 I finished school and, work on some videogames/boardgames project.
I started a personal project in 2020: Libertalia.
